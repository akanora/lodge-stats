# Product Context

## Problem Statement
Players on the Bhop servers need a centralized, web-based platform to track their performance, compare scores with others, and view server activity in real-time. The current solution (or lack thereof) may be outdated or insufficient, hence the need for a new, modern website.

## User Experience Goals
- **Visual Appeal**: The site should use a sleek, dark-themed design (`#0a0b1e` style backgrounds, neon accents) to match the gaming aesthetic.
- **Ease of Use**: Users should easily toggle between server tick rates without page reloads or complex navigation.
- **Accessibility**: Key information (Rank, Map, Time) should be instantly readable.
- **Searchability**: Finding specific player stats via Steam ID should be seamless.

## Functional Goals
- **Top Players**: Global ranking based on points.
- **Recent Times**: List of all recent map completions.
- **Recent Records**: List of recent server records (WRs/top times).
- **Server Toggle**: Distinct views or filters for 100t and 128t data.
