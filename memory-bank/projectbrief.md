# Project Brief

## Overview
Building a feature-rich, modern statistics website for Bhop servers "Lodge Stats". The platform will allow users to view top players, recent records, and recent times, with support for multiple server tick rates (100t and 128t).

## Core Requirements
- **Server Selection**: Toggle between 100 Tick and 128 Tick server stats.
- **Leaderboards**: "Top Players" page showing player rankings.
- **Activity Feed**: "Recent Records" and "Recent Times" pages showing live/recent activity.
- **Search**: Functionality to find players by Steam ID.
- **Design**: Premium, modern, dark-themed aesthetics based on provided visual references.

## Success Criteria
- Accurate reflection of server data (synced with `bhoptimer` database schema).
- Fast and responsive UI.
- Intuitive navigation between different data views and server tick rates.
- "Wow" factor in design using Vanilla CSS and modern web practices.
